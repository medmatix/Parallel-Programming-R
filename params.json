Motivation and background for parallel programming in R in the context of Data Science\r\n\r\n2.  Building and configuring an inexpensive Beowulf type Computing Cluster based on ARM6 processor driven RaspberryPI computers running an ARM6 opimized Debian Linux (Raspian).\r\n\r\n3.  Survey of the general and R specific approaches to parallel computing on linux based systems. \r\n\r\n4.  In depth Problem-oriented Programming projects using some of the specific R packages reviewed.\r\n\r\n5.  Selected other Advanced R Packages, Techniques and Problems\r\n\r\n\r\n##Background to Development of the Course\r\n\r\n-  **Beowulf clusters**\r\n\r\n-  **Raspberry PI 2 and  ARM6 processor**\r\n  see http://crunches-data.appspot.com/project8.html for my own built cluster project\r\n\r\n-  **System and Development Software**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Relationship to Data Science\r\n\r\n##Content Details Development\r\n\r\n##Project Problems development\r\n\r\n##Didactic Resources to Consider\r\n",
